# JUST-BE
A Photo booth is an automatic unit that takes photos with a DSLR camera, shows a preview on a touchscreen and allows users to print them. The Schaffenburg Hackerspace designed and built such a machine from scratch. In this presentation, I will talk about our motivation for starting such a big hobbyist project. Covered topics include: evaluation + selection of the used hardware and software components building the wooden case and 3d-printing parts using Arduino for effect lighting setting up the camera and external flash focus on the gstreamer- / gtk-based software demonstration problems and prospects
